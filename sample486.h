 * The DMA is configured to continually transfer samples from the ADC(s) into the 
 * ADC_Input_Buffer.  When the buffer is half-full or full, an interrupt is generated
 * to allow the valid samples to be translated into float values and handed to the user.
 * 
 * In Mono input mode, samples are 12-bits, left-aligned in the least significant 16 bits of each
 * word of the buffer.  In Stereo input mode, the least significant 16 bits holds channel 1,
 * and the most significant 16 bits holds the channel 2 data.
