ECE 486 Support for real-time DSP labs using the STM32F4-Discovery Boards

This collection of routines is designed to support real-time
DSP labs for the University of Maine ECE-486 Digital Signal
Processing course.

The processor is configured so that ADC1 and ADC2 sample analog input
signals.  The sample stream is buffered by a DMA, converted to type 
float, and passed to the user for processing.  The user processes the 
sampled data stream, and returns the floating point results to an
output buffer.  A second DMA is configured to stream the resulting data
to DAC1 and DAC2 for analog output. The user continually processes sequential
buffers of data allowing the analog signals to be (digitally) manipulated
in real-time.

GPIO Pins are configured such that all analog inputs/outputs are 
accessed in the first 20 pins of the P1 connector of the Discovery 
boards.  (Students use a connector with 20-pin ribbon cable to map
this portion of the P1-connector to a DIP socket, which they can 
plug into a standard prototyping board.

In addition to the analog ADC and DAC pins, limited digital GPIO outputs
are supported on the 20-pin interface, as well as the standard LEDs and 
user push-button interface from the Discovery boards.

All processor configuration (clocks, ADCs, DMAs, Timers, GPIO) is handled
by the library.  Users of the library can select:

  - Sample rates ranging from 500 Hz to 500 kHz
  - Mono or Stereo Analog Inputs
  - Mono or Stereo Analog Outputs
  - Adjustable data block sizes for streamed data 
    (down to 1-sample "blocks", if desired for low-latency applications)
    
Currently, ADC and DAC sample rates are locked together.  The on-board CODEC
is NOT used.  Rather, the 12-bit ADC(s) and 12-bit DAC(s) built into the
microcontroller are used.
